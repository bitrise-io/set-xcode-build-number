Set the value of your iOS app's bundle version in the `Info.plist` file to the specified version number.

<summary>Description</summary>

Set the value of your iOS app's bundle version in the `Info.plist` file to the specified version number. A great
way to keep track of versions when submitting bug reports.

If your IPA contains multiple build targets, they need to have the same version number as your app's main target has.
In that case, you need to add this Step to your Workflow for each build target: if you have, say, three targets, you need to have three instances of this Step in your Workflow.
If there are targets with different version numbers the app cannot be submitted for App Review or Beta App Review.

### Configuring the Step 

1. Set the file path to the `Info.plist` file in the `Info.plist` file path input.
1. Add a value in the Build Number input. 
   This sets the CFBundleVersion key to the specified value in the `Info.plist` file. The default value is the `$BITRISE_BUILD_NUMBER` Environment Variable.
1. Optionally, add a value in the Version Number input. This will set the `CFBundleShortVersionString` key to the specified value in the `Info.plist` file. This input is not required.
